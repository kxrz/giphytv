## GIF are fun! Let's have fun!

Everyone loves GIFs. Imagine a purfect world where you could download a zip, change some little simple things and create your own Giphy TV channel full of awesome GIFs anytime for any screens. I don't want to be rude, but, it's a reality now.

![This is a snapshot of the code](http://kxrz.me/GiphyTV/images/simple_custom.jpg)

4 things to configure in *config.js*:
1. Your API Key
2. A smart title
3. A good description
4. A keyword for GIFs

This website and project are not associated with Giphy in any way. I just love them for their GIFs.
